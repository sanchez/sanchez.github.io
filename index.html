                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                        I enjoy coding microcontrollers and modern web-based platforms, through Typescript, Sass, and React. In 2016 I was a video editor and producer for a couple of promotional videos at Emmanuel College and in the same year was head of the Emmanuel Rugby 7s IT.

                            Developing a webapp to control a SmartHome developed by group as part of my thesis at UQ. The webapp is built on React and uses a combination of HTTP API calls and Socket programming to ensure data is delivered quickly and reliably.

                        <h3>Emmanuel International Rugby 7s <span class="badge white-text">Removed</span></h3>
                            The main page for the Emmanuel 7s competition, with admin page to allow people to update scores and game times. This site was the goto place for the event volunteers and event participants, allowing them to get lightning fast update and results for different games, all from a glance. Sadly this page had to be taken down after the competition for technical reasons.
